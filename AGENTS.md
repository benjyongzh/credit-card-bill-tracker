# AGENTS.md

## Overview

This repository contains a full-stack application with a Java Spring Boot backend located in the `/server` directory.

AI agents working in this workspace are expected to run unit and integration tests against the backend using the Maven wrapper (`./mvnw test`). However, since some agents (like Codex or GitHub Copilot Workspace) may not have internet access or persistent caches, this file provides detailed instructions and constraints to enable test execution.

## Agent Objective

**Run the backend tests in `/server` using:**

```bash
cd server
./mvnw test
```

---

## Environment Setup for Agents

To ensure tests run successfully in offline or restricted environments, agents must follow the instructions below.

### âœ… Requirements

- Java 21+ (or compatible with your Spring Boot version)
- `./mvnw` and `.mvn/wrapper/*` must be present
- Valid `pom.xml` in `/server`
- All dependencies must be resolvable locally

### ðŸ§° Offline Dependency Preparation

If you're preparing the environment **before agent execution**, run the following:

```bash
cd server
./mvnw dependency:go-offline
```

This downloads all dependencies into the local Maven cache so agents can run `./mvnw test` without needing internet access.

If the agent can use `.m2`, ensure itâ€™s populated and restored before test execution.

---

## Agent Behavior (Reference Implementation)

Agents can use the following behavior logic when testing:

### TestRunnerAgent

```yaml
agent:
  name: TestRunnerAgent
  description: Executes backend unit and integration tests
  working_directory: /server
  steps:
    - description: Ensure working directory is correct
      command: cd /server
    - description: Verify Maven wrapper is present
      command: test -x ./mvnw
    - description: Verify pom.xml exists
      command: test -f pom.xml
    - description: Attempt to run tests
      command: ./mvnw -q test
      error_handling:
        if_failure: |
          If dependency resolution fails, first try:
            ./mvnw dependency:go-offline
          Then retry:
            ./mvnw test
```

## Troubleshooting for Agents

| Symptom                             | Possible Fix                                               |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `failed to fetch dependencies`      | Run `./mvnw dependency:go-offline` before testing          |
| `mvnw: command not found`           | Ensure you're in `/server` and `mvnw` has execute rights   |
| `permission denied: ./mvnw`         | Run `chmod +x mvnw` in `/server`                           |
| `Could not find or load main class` | Make sure dependencies are resolved                        |
| `Build fails with plugin errors`    | Plugins also need to be cached via `dependency:go-offline` |

---

## Example Workflow

### 1. Prepare the environment (if setting up manually)

```bash
cd server
./mvnw dependency:go-offline
```

### 2. Run tests

```bash
cd server
./mvnw test
```

---

## Best Practices

- Always commit the full Maven wrapper: `.mvn/`, `mvnw`, `mvnw.cmd`
- Avoid relying on remote parent POMs or snapshots during testing
- Avoid modifying `pom.xml` unless instructed

---

## Optional: Docker Testing Environment

If a consistent test environment is desired, define the following `Dockerfile`:

```Dockerfile
FROM maven:3.9-eclipse-temurin-17
WORKDIR /app
COPY server ./server
WORKDIR /app/server
RUN mvn dependency:go-offline
CMD ["mvn", "test"]
```

Build and test:

```bash
docker build -t springboot-tester .
docker run --rm springboot-tester
```

---

## Summary

This `AGENTS.md` ensures any capable AI agent can:

- Understand the backend project location
- Resolve Maven dependencies (or know how to prepare them)
- Execute tests using `./mvnw test` reliably

Agents should treat this file as canonical test instructions.
